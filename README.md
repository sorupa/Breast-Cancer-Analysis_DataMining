# Breast-Cancer-Analysis_DataMining
This R-tool analysis is using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29. I have used logistic regression, decision tree, neural network and SVM models to predict whether the tumor is benign or malignant based on several cell characteristics.

Here are the dataset attributes:

Attribute Information:

1. Sample code number: id number
2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
10. Mitoses: 1 - 10
11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)

Number of Instances: 699 

Class distribution:
 
   Benign: 458 (65.5%)
   Malignant: 241 (34.5%)
