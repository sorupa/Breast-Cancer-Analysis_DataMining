# Breast-Cancer-Analysis_DataMining
This is a anlysis using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29. I have used logistic regression, decision tree, neural network
and SVM models to predict whether the tumor is benign or malignant based on several cell characteristics.
